1.  What are the order of insertions/removals for the following data structures?

    Stack - Last In First Out (LIFO)
    Queue - First In First Out (FIFO)

2.  What is the retreival time complexity for the following data structures?

    Linked List - O(n)
    Hash Table - O(1)
    Binary Search Trees - O(log(n))

3.  What are some advantages to using a Hash Tables over an array in JavaScript?

    An array in Javascript operates in linear time, meaning that to search through an array one would need to iterate through each element. A hash table is organized into key-value pairs at an index and runs in constant time, therefore being more efficient.
